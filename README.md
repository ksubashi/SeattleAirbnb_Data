## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I chose the dataset of Seattle Airbnb to better understand the customer's behaviour in hospitality industry like:
1. What are the busiest times of the year and when do prices of apartments get lower?
2. Is there any increase in visitor's demand through time in Seattle?
3. What are the key indicators in apartments prices?
